Required to develop a standalone software application using Python to address a specific problem.
1. Translate problem statements into programmable solutions.
2. Develop a software application using basic Python programming concepts.

Instructions:
required to develop several applications or features typically
found within a TAR UMT Student Assistant App. For groups of THREE (3)
members, the program should display a main menu with the three applications.

Our choice of applications are:

1. Simple Reminder App
A Simple Reminder App allows users to set one-time or recurring reminders
for class, tasks, appointments, or important events. Users can receive
notifications at specified times, ensuring they don’t forget critical
responsibilities or deadlines.

2. GPA Calculator
A GPA Calculator helps students calculate their Grade Point Average based on
their course grades. Users input their grades and credit hours, and the app
computes their GPA, often providing options for different grading scales. The
app shall also be able to show the student’s academic performance in a
chart.

3. Study Pomodoro Timer
A Study Pomodoro Timer is designed to enhance student’s productivity by
using the Pomodoro Technique. It encourages users to work in focused
intervals (usually 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. The app typically
includes customizable time settings and tracking of completed sessions.

Ensure the code section should implement these features(selection, loops and while loops, string processing,
file processing, collections, functions, encapsulation, inheritance, graphical user interfaces - GUI, 
exception handling, comments and execution.
